Here's an example Python code implementing an LSTM algorithm for time series analysis using Keras:

Python

import numpy as np

from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def create_dataset(data, look_back=1):
"""
Creates a dataset for LSTM training.

Args:
data: A numpy array of time series data.
look_back: The number of previous time steps to consider as input.

Returns:
A tuple of (X_train, y_train), where X_train is a 3D array of training
samples and y_train is a 2D array of target values.

data = np.random.rand(100)

# Build the LSTM model

model.add(LSTM(50))

# Train the model
